Ride Comparison App

This app provides real-time price and time estimates across Uber, Lyft, and traditional taxi services by directly integrating with the official rideshare APIs. By connecting to Uber and Lyft's developer platforms, the system delivers accurate, up-to-the-minute pricing based on current demand, traffic conditions, and driver availability.
The application calculates precise estimates using the same data that powers the official apps, including distance, time of day, surge pricing factors, and vehicle type availability. Results are presented in an easy-to-compare format that helps users make informed transportation decisions. The lightweight Flask-based web interface includes an interactive map for selecting pickup and dropoff locations, with the ability to save frequent routes for quick access.
